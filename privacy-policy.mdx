This Privacy Policy explains how Synapse AI, Inc. and its affiliates ("Synapse AI," "we," "us," or "our") collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use our AI model fine-tuning platform, including our website, mobile applications, SDKs, APIs, model hub, and related services (collectively, the "Services"). We distinguish between our direct customers ("you") and your end-users to ensure clarity in our data practices. By accessing or using the Services, you agree to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use immediately.

- **Demographics & Preferences:** Optional information you choose to provide, such as your role, industry focus, preferences, or profile picture
- **Billing Information:** Payment details, billing address, and transaction history processed through our payment providers

### 1.2 Training Data & Model Information
As part of our AI model fine-tuning services, we may process:

- **Training Datasets:** Text, image, tabular, or other data formats you upload for model fine-tuning

**Important:** You retain full ownership of your model weights and training data. We process this information solely to provide fine-tuning services and do not use your proprietary data to train our own models or share it with third parties.

### 1.3 End-User Data (Customer-Controlled)
When your deployed models interact with end-users:

- **Inference Data:** Input queries and model responses processed through your deployed models
- **Performance Metrics:** Response times, accuracy metrics, and usage statistics

This data is processed according to your configuration and remains under your control. We do not access or store personally identifiable end-user information unless explicitly configured by you for specific services.

### 1.4 Usage & Technical Data
We automatically collect certain technical information to operate and improve our Services:

- **Device & Browser Info:** IP address, browser type and version, operating system, device identifiers

### 1.5 Third-Party Sources
We may receive information about you from third parties who support our marketing, analytics, payment processing, or authentication services. We use such data only to facilitate your experience and Service functionality.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- **Provide & Improve Services:** Authenticate users; process fine-tuning jobs; optimize model performance; diagnose technical issues; monitor platform usage; develop new features and model types
